# UI Package Boilerplate

Boilerplate for the TypeScript package development.

### Getting Started

> Note: I've used `pnpm` as the package manager, you can use any package manager like `npm` or `yarn` of your choice.

Clone the template using the below command

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Nazeeh21/npm-package-boilerplate.git ui-lib

cd ui-lib
pnpm install
```

To run the development server in `watch` mode, run the following command

```shell
pnpm start
```

To build the package, run the below command

```shell
pnpm build
```

I've commented pre-commit hook commands in the `.husky/pre-commit` file, feel free to uncomment the required commands as per your need.
